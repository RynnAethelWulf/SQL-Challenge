## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Data Modeling <br>
- Inspecting the CSVs and sketched out an ERD of the tables by use a tool like http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com.
Data Engineering <br>
Creating a table schema for each of the six CSV files.Specified data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints. <br>
For the primary keys checked to see if the column is unique, otherwise created a composite key. Which takes two primary keys in order to uniquely identify a row. <br>
Created tables in the correct order to handle foreign keys.Importe each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table. Imported the data in the same order that the tables were  created and accounted for the headers when importing to avoid errors.

### Summary
